## Why Go?

- Simple, readable, performant code.
- Compiles to native executables. Simplifies sharing games, and doesn't rely on just-in-time compilation.
- Garbage collection is very low latency, compared to Java or C# which focus on throughput.
- First-class support for concurrency, memory allocation, and unit testing.

## Getting Started (macOS)

```sh
make deps
